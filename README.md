grumpy-rumpy
============

An extremely grumpy turntable.fm bot.

Put Rumpy in a room and he'll allow a single DJ to play songs without having them blanked out by TT.

= Setup =

1. Install node.js
2. Install 'ttapi' via npm
3. Define $TT_AUTHID, $TT_USERID, and $TT_ROOMID in $ENV
4. `node rumpy.js`

Now you're running a rumpy.

How do you find your roomid, userid, and authtoken?
